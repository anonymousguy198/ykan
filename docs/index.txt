Ykan is a game engine powerd by Vulkan it makes it
easy to write games and apps without the hardnes of the vulkan setup
but if you want the best performance you can get it with custom
setup

Supported platforms
# normal,size 1.25
Ykan supports multiple target platforms,
it has been tested in the following platforms but,
technically, any platform that supports C language and Vulkan
or is dosent suport vulkan make the sistem support it with Swiftshader
but  any platform is valid for ykan or can be very easily ported to.
